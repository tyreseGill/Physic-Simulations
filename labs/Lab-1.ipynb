    "# Lab Report #1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem We’re Trying to Solve\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to simulate the projectile motion of a golf ball and adjust variables so that the ball lands in a target hole on an (x,y) plane.\n",
    "* The primary variables we will modify are:\n",
    "    1. $α$ – the launch angle of the ball\n",
    "    2. Initial velocity ($v_0$) – the magnitude of the ball’s initial speed\n",
    "\n",
    "By manipulating these variables, we aim to control the trajectory so the golf ball reaches the intended target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physics Relevant to Our Problem\n",
    "We are modeling the motion of a golf ball on an (x,y) coordinate plane, accounting for:\n",
    "1. Initial Conditions\n",
    "    - Initial position: $x_0$ (horizontal distance), $y_0$ (height)\n",
    "    - Initial velocity magnitude: $v_0$\n",
    "    - Launch angle: $α$\n",
    "2. Velocity Components\n",
    "    - Horizontal component: $v_x=v_0⋅cos⁡(α)$\n",
    "    - Vertical component: $v_y=v_0⋅sin⁡(α)$\n",
    "    - By splitting the velocity into x and y components, we can simulate motion in each direction independently.\n",
    "3. Forces and Motion\n",
    "    - Gravity: Acts downward along the y-axis ($F_y=m \\times g$)\n",
    "    - Mass: Constant throughout the simulation\n",
    "    - Momentum: Can be calculated as p=m⋅v using the velocity components\n",
    "4. Simulated vs. Theoretical Ball\n",
    "    - Theoretical Ball: Predicts where the ball would land based on initial conditions and classical projectile motion equations.\n",
    "    - Simulated Ball: Estimates the path and final position of the ball by updating velocity and position at discrete time steps.\n",
    "5. Numerical Method\n",
    "    - We use Newton’s Method (time-stepping approach) to update the ball’s velocity and position over small time intervals ($Δt$).\n",
    "    - Smaller $Δt$ values produce more accurate trajectories, closely matching real-world motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these physical principles and numerical updates, we can simulate the golf ball’s trajectory and fine-tune $α$ and $v_0$ to successfully reach the target hole."

The simulation incorporates fundamental physics principles such as Newton’s Laws, momentum, and projectile motion.\n",
    "1. **Initial Variables and Constants**: We first define the variables required for the physics formulas:\n",

    "2. **3D Objects**: Next, we set up the 3D objects for the simulation:\n",
    "    - ```golf_layout``` – A green box representing the golf course.\n",
    "    - ```simulated_ball``` – A red sphere representing the simulated ball; its motion is calculated step-by-step using momentum and forces.\n",
    "    - ```theoretical_ball``` – A blue sphere representing the theoretical trajectory calculated using kinematic equations.\n",
    "    - ```targeted_hole``` – A blue box representing the golf hole.\n",
    "3. **Graphing Velocity**: We set up a graph to track the ball’s speed over time.\n",
    "4. **Simulation Loop**: The simulation runs while the ball is above the ground ($y > 0$).\n",

    "#### Summary\n",

    "The graph in our simulation plots velocity magnitude $v$ against time $t$, forming coordinates $(t,v)$.\n",

    " \n",
    "Upon running the simulation, an upward-opening parabola appears in the graph, representing the ball’s trajectory:\n",
    "* Given that the parabola is opening up, velocity $v$ is moving in the positive direction, as it gradually decreases, reaches 0 m/s in the y-direction, and then starts to increase heading in the negative direction as it steepens.\n",
    "    * As shown on the speed graph, this illustrates the magnitude of velocity (speed) gradually decreasing, or slowing down, reaching 0 m/s in the y-direction, but remaining at a constant speed in the x direction, and then gradually increasing while speeding up as the ball falls to the ground over the time interval.\n",
    "* The graph starts initially at (0 s, 6.5 m/s) and decreases to about (0.6 s, 2.3 m/s) and ends at (1.2 s, 6.5 m/s)\n",
    "    * This shows us that the program runs from 0 seconds to approximately 1.2 seconds, meaning the ball’s travel time is 1.2 seconds.\n",
    "    * This suggests that the ball’s initial velocity is 6.5 m/s and final velocity is 6.5 m/s\n",
    "    * This reveals that the minimum velocity, maximum height, and turning point is at (0.6 s, 2.3 m/s)\n",
    "* The distance from the hole is approximately 7.786e-3 m.\n",
    "    * This communicates to us that the simulated ball has fallen in our digital hole (given that its distance is roughly equivalent to 0)\n",
    "    * This result can be attributed to the initial velocity of 6.5 m/s, the ball’s mass of 0.5 kg, the pull of gravity, and the angle of 68.9° at which the ball is projected. Combined with the formulas for force, momentum, change of momentum, and position update, we were able to calculate the trajectory of the ball and obtain such a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Does the Graph Behave the Way You Would Expect?*\n",
    "- As we would expect, the ball is initially at its fastest at 0 seconds. Between the interval $t = 0$ and $t ≈ 0.6$ the velocity is decreasing because it is facing the force gravity in the y-direction, therefore, as it travels upward, the speed is decreasing to 0 m/s in the y-direction. This is because at its max height, the velocity vector in the y-direction would be at rest, which is equal to 0 m/s. This means that its path of travel would be going in a curve that’s going up, but the ball is going to be decelerating in the y-axis so the curve is going to taper off eventually since its speed goes to 0 m/s at its highest point.\n",
    "- However, in the graph, it shows that the speed (magnitude of velocity) never reaches 0 m/s directly. But it does not change at around 0.6 s. This is because the velocity in the vertical direction is at 0 m/s, but the horizontal velocity is always constant and above 0 m/s, which means it’s moving to the right at the same pace through its flight. So, the graph still displays what we want since it’s taking into account the absolute value of velocity in all directions. So, it’s going to be decreasing from the time interval between 0 and 0.6 seconds, and increasing for the rest in the opposite direction as it approaches free fall with gravity acting on it. In turn, this causes it to decelerate, increasing speed whilst decreasing its velocity.\n",
    "- Then for the second half of the graph ($t = 0.6$ to $t = 1.2$), the speed is going to be increasing in the opposite direction, which means that the velocity is going to be decreasing overall, which is what our graph shows. And this graph does support the path of the golf ball’s travel, so the graph does behave in the way we expect overall."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;In summary, through the use of code and implementation of physics formulas, we were able to generate a simulation for the projectile motion of a ball as well as a graph plotting the speed. Additionally, we used code to find the distance from the hole the ball ended up in at each trial, and were able to land the ball in the hole by manipulating the angle. First, for the code that illustrates the problem, we used various physics equations that updated the position of the theoretical & simulated ball pathways. Specifically, for the simulated ball, we used the Momentum Principle and Position Update formulas in order to extrapolate certain variables that would be updated each step of the way within the while loop until the simulated ball returns to the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;For the theoretical ball, we used the Position Update formulas specific to each direction in the vector (x, y, z), along with a constantly updating difference in time embedded in the loop in order to find a more accurate travel of the ball until it would hit the ground that we created in VPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;We also made a graph that showcased the magnitude of velocity (speed) as the ball went through its path of travel over a duration of time. It represented the ball’s path of travel quite well since it showed the speed decreasing as it moved from the ground upwards against the pull of gravity to reach its highest point, and then it showed it increasing as it moved downwards toward the ground with gravity.\n",
    "The graph accurately depicted the scenario that we wanted to emulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;And then we outputted how far the ball ended up being from the hole at its final landing position.\n",
    "And at the end, through trial and error, we figured out what the initial velocity’s angle had to be in order for it to hit the hole by the end. To note, the initial velocity’s angle ended up needing to be 68.9 degrees for it to hit the hole.\n",
