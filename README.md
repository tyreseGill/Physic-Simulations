# Physics Lab Simulations & Analysis  

This repository contains a collection of physics lab simulations and written analysis, developed with **VPython** and organized into **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)**.

Each lab includes:  
- Problem statement and background  
- Explanation of physics principles  
- Interactive VPython simulations  
- Graphs and analysis of results  
- Conclusions  

# A Glimpse of What Will be Covered 
* *What would happen if the Earth were to have the same mass as the Sun?*

* *What are the forces at work on a ball attached to a fixed object via a spring?*
![Forces Acting Between a Spring and a Ball](assets/gifs/Lab-4/Spring_Mass.gif)
* *What is the effect of air resistance on free-falling coffee filters?*

* *What would happen if two objects with equal mass and a spring between them were to collide?*

## Running the Simulations
![Ball Bouncing Off Wall With VPython](assets/gifs/Other/Ball_Bouncing_Off_Wall.gif)
All simulations and their corresponding output can be found via [GlowScript](https://www.glowscript.org/), a platform that we used to write and host the simulations listed in this repository. No account is needed to view the simulation nor is there a requirement to download any packages.
